This is a barebones Roblox executor built for one purpose: running scripts. It’s not pretty, it’s not polished, but it gets the job done (most of the time). If you’re looking for flashy UIs, auto-updates, or built-in script hubs… look elsewhere.

it has a shit ui 

no script hub 

no script tabs 

auto attach sucks rn 

updates wont come unless needed or i feel like making the ui better


thats all other wise this is the best executer cause its safe :p
